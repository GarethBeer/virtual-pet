Virtual Pet!

CREATING THE DIRECTORY - FIRST STEPS:

Create a virtual-pet directory from the command line

Initialize an NPM project in that repository

    Using: npm init

Initialize a git repository within that directory

using: git init

Install Jest and save it as a dev dependency

    using: npm i -D jest

Set Jest as the test command for your project

    package.json - test: "jest"

Create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it

    command line: in dir -  touch .gitignore
                    code .
                    open .gitignore and write node_modules

Create a README.md file from the command line

    command line: in dir - touch README.md

Write a clear README

    see above

Add the README.md to the staging area

    command line: in dir git add .

Commit your changes with a clear message

    command line: git commit -m 'type a message here'

Push the project to GitHub

    command line: git push orign master
